👨‍💻 Darshan Varu - Computer Engineering Student.
👋 Hi there! I'm a passionate Flutter developer from India, dedicated to creating user-friendly, visually smooth apps. I’m currently working on projects like Quoterr, an app for delivering quotes on demand, and a direct market access app to support farmers. My approach centers on clean, effective error handling, intuitive animations, and immersive UI elements. I’m always exploring ways to deepen my understanding of data analysis and data visualization. Let’s build something amazing together!
